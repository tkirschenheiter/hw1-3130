Homework 1 - Spotify Chart Data Linked List

This repository was created to demonstrate the implementation of reading in a file and sorting it, then putting the data into a linked list.

*Note* I changed the file into a TSV file (program will only work with TSVs) because of the extra use of commas in song and artist names. 
To use program simply convert any CSV into a TSV.

Author notes. This repository was created by Professor Katherine Chuang for use with teaching at Brooklyn College's Department of CIS.
