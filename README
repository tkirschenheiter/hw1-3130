Homework 1 - Spotify Chart Data Linked List

This repository was created to demonstrate the implementation of reading in a file and sorting it, then putting the data into a linked list.

Author notes. This repository was created by Taylor Kirschenheiter for assignment 1 of CISC 3130.
I changed the file into a TSV file (program will only work with TSVs) because of the extra use of commas in song and artist names. 
To use program simply convert any CSV into a TSV.

Installation/Set-Up:
Open both java files within a project. Replace path of files (scanner & output stream) with desired path of files on own computer. Run program.

Dependencies:
Java 8

Output:
ArtistOutput.txt contains programs output
